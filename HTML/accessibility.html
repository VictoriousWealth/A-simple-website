					<h2>Accessibility statement</h2>
					<p>
						This accessibility statement applies to this website name and only.
						
						This website is run by the author, name at the end of the page. This website strives to be accessible to as many as it can, meaning you should be able to:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>zoom in up to 150% without the text spilling off the screen;</li>
							<li>listen to the website using a screen reader (including <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/">NonVisual Desktop Access</a>, Microsoft Narrator <span class="italic">(for Microsoft and Windows users)</span>, <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100?hl=en">Google TalkBack</a> <a class="italic" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&hl=en_US">(app version existent for android devices)</a> and <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-provides-free-window-eyes-screen-reader-for-the-visually-impaired/">Window-Eyes</a>).</li>
						</ul>
							
					<p>
						I have also ensured that any of the website's text and images are as simple as possible to understand.
						
						<br><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

						<li><span class="special-list-item">Introduction</span>
						The ShefFamily's website is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. I am continually improving user experience and striving to adhere to the relevant accessibility standards.</li>
						
						<br><li><span class="special-list-item">Accessibility Features</span>I have implemented the following features:</li>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold">Alternative text</span> for all images, providing information about the content and function of images, helping users who rely on screen readers.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Semantic HTML</span>, i.e. the website uses different types of headings to structure content, different types of lists</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Keyboard accessibility</span>, ensuring that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using the keyboard alone. I did this due to knowing that it is crucial for users who may not be able to use a mouse.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Focus indication</span>, so users who rely on screen readers, can understand where they are on the page by focusing on links which change color when they are in focus </li>
							<li><span class="bold">Form accessibility</span> to an extent, as in, all the forms on the website include clear labels on each field. However, no error messages are produced.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Text contrast</span> against its background, making it easier to read for users with vision impairement.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Resizable text</span> without any loss of content or functionality up to 280px in width screen.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Responsive design</span>, meaning, adapting to different screen sizes, benefiting users who may be using a variety of devices.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Consistent navigation</span> throughout the website, aiding users in understanding and navigating the site.</li>
						</ol>
						 
						<br><li><span class="special-list-item">Assistive Technologies Compatibility</span>My website is designed to be compatible with some commonly used assistive technologies, i.e. screen readers and keyboard navigation.</li>
