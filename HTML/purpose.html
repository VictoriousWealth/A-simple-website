						<li>Inputs to the planning of curriculum changes;</li>
						<li>Departmental services (e.g. hand-in arrangements, office opening times, 
							study facilities, the departmental network, availability of personal 
							tutors etc.);</li>
						<li>Improving channels of communication between staff and students students.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<article>
					<p class="paragraph">

						<ul>
							<li>Which reps will attend SSLCom, if not all</li>
							<li>What points they plan to raise at SSLCom</li>
						</ul>
